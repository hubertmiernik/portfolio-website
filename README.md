# 🚀 Portfolio Website

Welcome to **Portfolio Website**, a modern and dynamic portfolio built with the latest technologies. This project showcases my skills and experience as a developer, featuring interactive animations, 3D elements, and a polished design—all powered by React, Next.js, and Three.js. Let's dive in!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project leverages a powerful combination of technologies:

- **Next.js**: SSR, SSG, and optimized performance.
- **React 18**: The backbone of the app with hooks and concurrent features.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Efficient state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for responsive design.
- **Three.js / react-three-fiber**: 3D rendering and animations.
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions.
- **Lottie**: Beautiful vector animations.
- **AOS**: Scroll animations for an engaging user experience.
- **Day.js**: Handling date and time elegantly.

## 🎨 Features

- 🖼️ **Interactive 3D Globe**: Powered by `three` and `three-globe`.
- 💻 **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on any device with `tailwindcss`.
- 🚀 **Optimized Performance**: Thanks to Next.js' static and server-side rendering.
- 🔥 **Animations Everywhere**: Beautiful animations with `AOS`, `Framer Motion`, and `Lottie`.

```

Your app will be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🔧 Building for Production

Build the optimized production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## 💡 Key Libraries

- **@react-three**: Integrates Three.js with React for 3D visualizations.

- **Swiper.js**: Modern touch slider for images and content.
- **React Hook Form**: Simplified form handling with validation via Yup.

## 🚀 Deployment

To deploy the app, you can use platforms like Vercel or Netlify. Since this is a Next.js app, deployment is as simple as connecting your repo and hitting deploy!

For example, with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):
1. Connect your repository.
2. Configure the environment variables if needed.
3. Deploy!

## 🎉 What's Next?

This is just the beginning! Here's what I'm planning to add in the future:
- 📊 **Analytics Integration**: Google Analytics or Plausible for tracking.
- 💬 **Live Chat Feature**: Real-time communication via socket.io.
- 📷 **Photography Showcase**: A beautiful gallery to highlight my photography hobby.
